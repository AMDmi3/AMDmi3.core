## FreeBSD Ports

- I [maintain](https://repology.org/maintainer/amdmi3%40freebsd.org)
  over 380 [ports](https://www.freshports.org/search.php?stype=maintainer&method=exact&query=amdmi3%40FreeBSD.org&num=500&orderby=category&orderbyupdown=asc&search=Search&format=html&branch=head) at time of writing and do my best to keep them
  working and up to date.
- I've done [over 15k](https://www.freshports.org/graphs.php?id=20)
  to the Ports tree since 2008 (and have submitted some more changes
  as a mere contributor before that).
- Apart from individual port commits, I've done some infrastructural
  changes:
  - `sdl.mk` ([commit](https://cgit.freebsd.org/ports/commit/?id=14223135a0ec1fc40ededbe70b4ad5ce27bbbf18)).
  - `make test` support ([commit](https://cgit.freebsd.org/ports/commit/?id=5c572259877cd7ca5a4290778fe5ebabf9dfb2a0)).
  - `license.mk` improvements ([commit](https://cgit.freebsd.org/ports/commit/?id=d861678bdefc371a8cb6bf3d2c316437130a0b33)).
  - `SHEBANGFIX` improvements ([commit](https://cgit.freebsd.org/ports/commit/?id=67971bd0fb8a440f973d12606b0f496ba216d7df)).
  - Python support improvements ([article]({{< ref "/posts/python-3.11-in-freebsd-ports/index" >}})).

## Vangers

I took part in porting of (somewhat legendary)
[Vangers: One for the Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vangers)
game to cross platform. Unfortunately, VCS history was lost, but
the source code is [available](https://github.com/KranX/Vangers/).
Some screenshots of Vangers running on my FreeBSD back from 2008:
