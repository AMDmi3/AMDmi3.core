The [portability ABC]({{< ref "/posts/portability-abc-intro" >}})
activity has kind of stalled, most probably because I've attempted
to bite off too large a piece - that is, to write too huge article
at once, in two languages on top of that. There are two such articles
in the drafts, and the amount of work needed before posting them
is demotivating. So I'll try to switch to smaller posts now.

Apart from that, I'm thinking of a new name, as the topic is actually
closer to packaging friendliness than to portability. Something
like "A Guide To Portability And Packaging Friendliness" (GPPF)
maybe?
