15 years later I'm finally writing the first post.

<!--more-->

It took so long to start because I've set the bar quite high as
I wanted to have some worthy articles ready, learn a new tool for
static blog management and improve my frontend skills writing a
modern HTML/CSS theme from scratch, all at once to start this.
Several attempts were required.

Regarding the most important - content, I'm hesitant even still if
it can be useful to public, while the wildest desire would be for
it to be *inspiring*, but I have no illusions of that it would be
easy. But you never know until you try, so I'm setting the goals
for this blog in the order of increasing desirability yet hardness
to accomplish:

* Improve my writing skills in two languages. This blog is bilingual
  and I plan to keep each post and article dubbed in both English and
  Russian.
* Write down useful ideas, guides and drafts for myself. There's no
  better way to ensure longevity and quality of information which
  needs to be preserved than making it public.
* Share my knowledge and experience. These 15 years haven't passed
  in vain and I have learned and done a lot of things in F/OSS
  community, and my passion for it have grown manyfold.
* Hopefully inspire others. To contribute to F/OSS, fix bugs, write
  ports, explore and learn.

Topics to cover:
* Software packaging, particularly related to FreeBSD ports.
  * Specifically, I plan series of posts of how I make ports for
    new software.
  * I plan another series covering common software portability
    problems, which could be compiled into something like a portability
    handbook.
* F/OSS gamedev, particularly reimplementing classic games in form
  of Free Software.
* Contributing to and improving Free/Open Source Software in general.
* C++ and Python programming.
* FreeBSD development and usage.
* Privacy, freedom of speech, decentralization, and censorship
  countering.
* Maybe some real-life activities to dilute technical content a bit?

I don't plan to post regularly. I preserve right to update and
remove outdated posts. I'm totally open to feedback (via
[email](mailto:amdmi3@amdmi3.ru),
[fediverse](https://fosstodon.org/@AMDmi3),
[telegram](https://telegram.me/AMDmi3),
or [issue](https://github.com/AMDmi3/AMDmi3.core/issues) for this blogs
repository), including spelling and grammar fixes and better
wording suggestions.

Here goes!
