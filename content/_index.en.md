I'm Dmitry Marakasov, [Free Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Free_Software_Definition#The_Four_Essential_Freedoms_of_Free_Software) developer.
My primary languages are C++ and Python, interests include [FreeBSD](https://freebsd.org/), software packaging, software portability, F/OSS gamedev and improving Free Software, Hardware, and Data ecosystem in general. I try to contribute to everything I can get my hands on.

My most notable projects and contributions are:
* I maintain over 350 ports and have made over 15k commits to [FreeBSD ports collection](https://www.freebsd.org/ports/).
* I'm author of [Repology](https://repology.org/), a service which aggregates packaging information from over 300 repositories for the benefit of software authors and package maintainers.
* I maintain some C++ libraries:
  * [libversion](https://github.com/repology/libversion/) - a library to compare software versions in all their variety;
  * [libSDLpp](https://github.com/libSDL2pp/libSDL2pp) - C++ wrapper for SDL.
* I maintain some Python modules:
  * [aesqlapius](https://pypi.org/project/aesqlapius/) - a tool to conveniently organize SQL queries and use them as Python API;
  * [jsonslicer](https://pypi.org/project/jsonslicer/) - a fast stream parser for large JSON files;
  * [libversion](https://pypi.org/project/libversion/) - a python wrapper for libversion listed above.
* I've reimplemented [XKCD #1608 "Hoverboard"](https://xkcd.com/1608/) game as a [native application](https://github.com/AMDmi3/hoverboard-sdl).
* I maintain some third party projects abandoned by their authors:
  * [flops](https://github.com/AMDmi3/flops) - a small benchmark by Al Aburto;
  * [Trip on the Funny Boat](https://github.com/AMDmi3/funnyboat) - a side scrolling arcade shooter game by Pekka "pekuja" Kujansuu et al.;
  * [QNetWalk](https://github.com/AMDmi3/qnetwalk) - a game for system administrators by Andi Peredri.
* In the past I've actively contributed to [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) and have written some related tools:
  * [tiletool](https://github.com/AMDmi3/tiletool) - a map tile processing tool;
  * [opening_hours.js](https://github.com/AMDmi3/opening_hours.js), a javascript library to parse and process opening hours format used in OSM;
  * [glosm](https://github.com/AMDmi3/glosm), a realtime 3D OpenStreetMap renderer;
  * [streetmangler](https://github.com/AMDmi3/streetmangler), a street name normalization tool for OSM.
* I took part in making classic [Vangers](https://github.com/KranX/Vangers) game cross-platform and available under Linux.
* I've contributed to [hundreds](https://www.openhub.net/accounts/AMDmi3/positions) other F/OSS projects.

That is roughly what I write about in this blog.
